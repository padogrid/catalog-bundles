# PadoGrid Bundle Catalogs

This repo provides online catalogs of PadoGrid bundles that are readily available for installation.

- [Geode/GemFire Bundle Catalog](geode-catalog.md)
- [Hazelcast/Jet Bundle Catalog](hazelcast-catalog.md)

## About Bundles

Each bundle listed in the catalogs is fully tested and includes detailed architecture documents. Bundles range from simple tutorials to fully implemented use cases providing out-of-the-box enterprise solutions to complex fast data and big data problems.

- A bundle may span a single node to hundreds of nodes.
- A bundle may run on PC, VMs, Kubernetes and/or Docker.
- A bundle may contain apps along with complete end-to-end integration points such as database, Kafka, BI tools, etc.
- A bundle may contain a prototype, demoware, examples, tests, a production system, etc.
- *A bundle is a use case. Just install and run.*

For bundle details, see the [Understanding Bundles](https://github.com/padogrid/padogrid/wiki/Understanding-Bundles) section in the [PadoGrid Manual](https://github.com/padogrid/padogrid/wiki).
